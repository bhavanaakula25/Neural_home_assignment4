**Student Name:** Bhavana Akula  
**Course:** CS5720 - Neural Networks and Deep Learning  
**Assignment Title:** Home Assignment 4  
**Semester:** Summer 2025

## Description
This assignment covers theoretical and practical concepts related to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), data poisoning attacks, adversarial examples, and responsible AI practices. It includes:

- A set of theoretical questions focused on GAN training, adversarial robustness, and AI ethics.
- A hands-on implementation of a GAN using PyTorch.
- Training results with visualizations.
- Reflections on responsible AI development.

## Files Included
- `Home_Assignment_4.ipynb` – The Jupyter Notebook with all code and outputs.
- `Home_Assignment_4_Presentation.pdf` – A presentation script explaining each question in detail.
- `README.txt` – This file, providing an overview of the assignment.

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Install required libraries using:
   ```
   pip install torch torchvision matplotlib
   ```
3. Run all cells sequentially to train the GAN and view the output images.
